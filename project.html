A computer is a programmable device that stores, retrieves, and processes data. The term "computer" was originally given
to humans (human computers) who performed numerical calculations using mechanical calculators, such as the abacus and
slide rule. The term was later given to mechanical devices as they began replacing human computers. Today's computers
are electronic devices that accept data (input), process that data, produce output, and store (storage) the results
(IPOS).

                            The first digital computer and what most people think of as a computer was called the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical
                            Integrator and Computer). It was built during World War II (1943-1946) and was designed to help automate the
                            calculations being done by human computers. By doing these calculations on a computer, they could achieve results much
                            faster and with fewer errors.
                            
                            Early computers like the ENIAC used vacuum tubes and were large (sometimes room size) and only found in businesses,
                            universities, or governments. Later, computers began utilizing transistors and smaller and cheaper parts that allowed
                            the ordinary person to own a computer.

                        A computer does not require all the components mentioned above. However, a computer cannot function without having at
                        the very minimum the parts listed below.
                        <ul class="gop">
                            <li>
                                Processor - Component that executes instructions from the software and hardware.
                            </li>
                            <li>
Memory - Temporary primary storage for data traveling between the storage and CPU.
                            </li>
                            <li>
Motherboard (with onboard video) - Component that connects all components.
                            </li>
                            <li>
Storage device (e.g., hard drive) - Slower secondary storage that permanently stores data.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="roz">However, if you had a computer with only the minimum parts above, you would be unable to communicate with it until you
                        connected at least one input device (e.g., keyboard). Also, you would need at least one output device (e.g., monitor)
                        for you to see what is happening.
